Description: This package provides a roclet for roxygen2 that identifies and 
    processes code blocks in your documentation marked with `@longtests`. These
    blocks should contain tests that take a long time to run and thus cannot be 
    included in the regular test suite of the package. When you run 
    `roxygen2::roxygenise` with the `longtests_roclet`, it will extract these 
    long tests from your documentation and save them in a separate directory.
    This allows you to run these long tests separately from the rest of your 
    tests, for example, on a continuous integration server that is set up to 
    run long tests.
